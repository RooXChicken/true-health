# True Health
This mod shows you your True Health (the in game decimal number) right above your hot-bar. This let's you see how much health you ACTUALLY have, instead of Minecraft's system of always rounding up.

This get's around the problem of Minecraft showing you that you have X hearts, when really it's way closer to having X-1 hearts.

Default key-bind to toggle the mod is H
